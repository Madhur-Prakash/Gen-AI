# Gen-AI
**A Repository for Generative AI Practice**

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to practicing and exploring various aspects of Generative AI. It includes a collection of models, with a focus on a standout model that accepts PDF files as input, divides them into manageable chunks, processes the content, and allows users to query the information through the model.

---

## Features
- **PDF Processing**: The model can take PDF files as input and divide them into smaller, more manageable chunks for processing.
- **Question Answering**: After processing the PDF, users can ask questions related to the content, and the model will provide relevant answers.
- **Generative AI Practice**: This repository serves as a platform for experimenting with different Generative AI models and techniques.

---

## Technology Stack
- **Backend Framework**: Not specified
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **AI Frameworks/Libraries**: Various Generative AI libraries and frameworks

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [git@github.com:Madhur-Prakash/Gen-AI.git](https://github.com/Madhur-Prakash/Gen-AI.git)
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Gen-AI
   ```
3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the model server:
   ```bash
   # Command to start the server, if applicable
   ```
2. Use the model to process a PDF and ask questions:
   - Provide the PDF file as input to the model.
   - The model will process the PDF, dividing it into chunks.
   - Once processed, you can ask questions related to the PDF content.
